# CRUD Web App

This is a simple **CRUD Web Application** built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **Entity Framework Core**.  
It demonstrates basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with a SQL Server database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: The web framework used for building the application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for database access and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **SQL Server**: Database used to store client records.
- **Razor Views**: The view engine used to render HTML views in the browser.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used to build the application.
- **Visual Studio**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and debugging the application.

## üìö Features

- **Add**: Create new client records with details like name, email, phone number, and address.
- **View**: View a list of all clients along with their details.
- **Edit**: Modify an existing client's information.
- **Delete**: Remove client records from the database.
- **Database integration**: The application uses **Entity Framework Core** to interact with a **SQL Server** database for storing client records.
- **MVC architecture**: Implements the Model-View-Controller pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Validation**: Input validation is done both client-side (using jQuery) and server-side (using C# DataAnnotations).
- **Error handling**: Custom error pages (404 and 500) are implemented for better user experience.
- **Responsive design**: The application is fully responsive and built with **Bootstrap** for better user experience on mobile devices.
